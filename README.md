### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Demonstrate a working knowledge of object properties and methods.
- Create objects using constructor notation and instances of those objects using the new keyword.
- Compare and contrast creating objects using literal notation vs. constructor notation.
- Define methods on custom objects by attaching them to the prototype.
- Understand object inheritance.

Objects have both data and behavior.
First part of our lesson = data
second part = behavior


Board: let's write 


In object-oriented programming, we use objects to represent logical and
often physical concepts, such as students, books, and even delicious
sandwiches. In object-oriented programming (OOP), our objects should
not only allow us to encapsulate data (i.e. gather and store values
that are attributes of the object, such as meat and condiments in a
sandwich), but also allow us to reuse the data structure without
constantly redefining it.
In other words, we should only have to define the properties of a sandwich
one time and then be able to create as many different sandwiches as we
want without repeating ourselves.
Is there a way to use JavaScript to create a template for a sandwich object that we can use
to construct many different sandwiches?

Lab:
Create a constructor function for each of the following:
Dog with name, breed, and age properties
Cat with name, breed, and age properties
Bird with name, breed, age,  properties

Classes:


-  Explain what a method is and the difference between a method and a function.
-  Add an action to a constructor function.
-  Explain what this is in the context of an object.
-  Create ES6 classes.
-  Explain ES6 class inheritance with extends.
